Workshop On Self-Education in software testing

## Setting up local development environment

Site is built by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) theme.

The only requirement is [Node.js 16 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In root directory of this repository, run:

    $ npm install

To start development server, run:

    $ npm run start

Go to <http://localhost:1313/> to see how it looks. Site is rebuilt automatically as files on disk change.

To build production version of the website, run:

    $ npm run build

You can find generated files in `public` subdirectory.
