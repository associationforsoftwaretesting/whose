## Definition:

The process of \'creating\' a list with identified and analyzed risk items which is ordered on its risk exposure.
See also the following related sections in this documents:.

* Classify the impact of the risk (e.g. High, Medium, Low)
* Classify the probability of the risk (e.g. High, Medium, Low)
* Perform criticality ordering of the composite risk list , e.g. High severity and High probability would be tested, while a Low severity and low probability would not be tested

## A context where I used this skill:

I used this during the test impact, when I created a list with identified and analyzed risk items.
Each risk item get a priority \'assigned\' based on its risk exposure.
Risk exposure is defined by the relationship of Probability and Impact What you need to do.

* Consider what can go wrong that can influence the project
* Determine what the most likely outcome would be -- Impact, Consequences
* Determine how likely those consequences are -- Probability, Likelihood
* Calculate the risk exposure i.e. Impact \* Probability
* Action can be taken based on risk exposure, i.e. priority

## How I\'d recommend someone learn this skill:

Just take average situations in life.
Consider what can go wrong for that situation.
Determine the probability and impact based on the information you have at that moment.
With a \"value\" for probability and impact, you can \'calculate\' the risk exposure.
